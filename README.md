Goldpan v1: Smart Membership Data Processor
🚀 Introduction
Goldpan v1 is a custom Python-based data processing tool designed to transform raw customer membership and order data into highly organized, actionable insights. Built as a lightweight Flask web application, it streamlines the complex task of deduplicating customer records, enriching them with financial metrics, and applying dynamic segmentation tags.

This tool was specifically developed to overcome limitations in standard CRM systems like HubSpot, allowing for advanced data manipulation and custom property generation that would otherwise require expensive upgrades (e.g., HubSpot Operations Hub Professional) or extensive manual effort.

⚙️ How Goldpan v1 Works (The Process Flow)
Goldpan v1 operates by taking two key Excel files as input, performing a series of intelligent transformations, and then generating tailored output files for different purposes:

Input:
Membership Data File: Contains core customer and membership details (Customer Name, Email, Start Date, Expiration Date, Customer ID, etc.).
Orders Data File: Contains individual customer order records (SAP ID, Total Value).
Core Processing Steps:
Order Data Enrichment: Combines customer order data with membership data to calculate Total Order Value and Estimated Savings for each customer.
Smart Deduplication: Identifies and resolves duplicate customer records based on renewal patterns, ensuring a clean and accurate customer base.
Membership Categorization: Groups memberships into broad categories like 'Active', 'Expiring Soon', and 'Expired' and sorts them for initial overview.
Dynamic Flagging: Calculates a comprehensive set of boolean (True/False) flags for each customer, indicating specific membership statuses and value tiers. This is the heart of the segmentation logic.
Output Generation:
HubSpot CSV Export: A specialized CSV file ready for direct import into HubSpot, featuring a multi-select Membership Status Tags property for seamless CRM integration and Smart List creation.
Detailed Excel Analysis Export: A comprehensive Excel file containing all original data plus the newly calculated financial metrics and individual True/False columns for every membership status flag. This is ideal for detailed verification, ad-hoc analysis, and custom reporting.
🔧 Core Processes Explained
Goldpan v1 is built upon a modular architecture, with each function handling a specific data transformation:

process_orders_and_add_value_tiers(membership_df, orders_df)
What it does: Takes raw membership and order data. It sums up all Total Value from the orders_df for each SAP ID (which maps to Cust ID in the membership data).
Output: Adds Total Order Value (total spend by the customer) and Estimated Savings (calculated as 8% of Total Order Value) columns to the membership DataFrame.
Benefit: Enriches customer profiles with critical financial insights, enabling value-based segmentation.
deduplicate_memberships(df)
What it does: Processes the membership data to identify and remove duplicate entries for the same customer. It applies intelligent renewal logic: if a customer has multiple memberships where a newer membership Created Date is within 7 days of an older membership's Expiration Date, the older membership is considered a renewal and is deduplicated, keeping the most recent active record.
Output: A DataFrame with a clean, deduplicated list of customer memberships.
Benefit: Ensures data accuracy, prevents duplicate outreach, and provides a true count of unique active customers.
categorize_and_sort_memberships(df)
What it does: Calculates the Days Until Expiration for each membership based on the current date. It then assigns a broad Expiration Category (e.g., 'Expired', 'Expiring Soon', 'Active') and sorts the DataFrame accordingly.
Output: DataFrame sorted by expiration status, with a temporary 'Expiration Category' column (which is later removed for specific exports if more granular flags are used).
Benefit: Provides an initial high-level overview of membership health and aids in internal analysis.
_calculate_all_membership_flags(df)
What it does: This is the core intelligence engine of Goldpan v1. It takes the processed DataFrame and systematically evaluates each customer against a set of predefined business rules to generate granular boolean (True/False) flags. These rules include:
_is_high_value: Based on Total Order Value > $1000.
_is_hfo_buy: Based on the presence of a value in the 'Original Pu' field.
_is_active_membership: Based on today >= Start Date AND today < Expiration Date.
_is_expiring_soon: Based on expiration within the next 30 days.
_is_recently_renewed: Based on Start Date being within the last 30 days.
Output: The input DataFrame augmented with new columns for each of these boolean flags (e.g., _is_high_value, _is_active_membership).
Benefit: Centralizes and standardizes the complex segmentation logic, making it maintainable and consistent across all outputs. This is where the magic of automated, precise segmentation happens.
format_for_hubspot_export(df)
What it does: Takes the DataFrame with all the calculated boolean flags and converts them into a single, semicolon-separated Membership Status Tags string property. This format is crucial for direct import into HubSpot's multi-select fields. It also selects and orders specific columns required for HubSpot, and removes internal helper columns.
Output: A clean CSV file perfectly structured for HubSpot import.
Benefit: Enables seamless integration of rich customer segmentation into HubSpot, allowing for the creation of dynamic Smart Lists and automated workflows.
add_individual_boolean_tags_for_excel(df)
What it does: Takes the DataFrame with all the calculated boolean flags and expands them into explicit (True) and (False) columns for each tag (e.g., High-Value Customer (True), High-Value Customer (False)). This output is primarily for verification and detailed analysis in Excel.
Output: A comprehensive Excel file with all original data plus new financial metrics and detailed boolean flag columns.
Benefit: Provides full transparency into how each customer was tagged, facilitating manual review, ad-hoc reporting, and deep-dive analysis.
